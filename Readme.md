# What is Version Control?
When we are working on a big project, it is extremely important to store all the changes that are being made to recall it at a later stage. Version Control Systems are software tools that help with it. They keep track of all the modifications that happen over time in the source code as versions. They also allow us to go through older versions and revert to an old version if required.
There are many version control systems such as Git, Mercurial, CVS, and SVN. Git is the most popular and most widely used version control system in the industry.

# GitHub

GitHub is a code hosting platform for collaboration using the Git Version Control System. In laymanâ€™s term, it is the place where you keep all your projects and multiple people can work together on those projects.

Good resources to get started with GitHub:
- https://lab.github.com/
- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWYqp7iY_Tc&feature=youtu.be
- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGOj5yH7evk

Note that you do not need to be a master in VCS/Git/GitHub to start contributing. Once you are comfortable with the basics, you can start contributing to open-source.
